										<h2>Mining with Ubuntu 64Bit</h2>

										<p>If you have a spare PC or have access to a virtual Machine, Linux mining is the way to go. It is the most effective and our script will make sure you get the best performance. Below you will find a list of the altcoins we currently have guides for. On the next pages you will be presented with the final script tailored for your setup. You will be able to start mining in a few minutes in Linux even if you are totally new to this. The generated script will download all dependencies, will compile the miner for your machine and will start mining, sending you the coins to an address you will specify. It is very easy Just follow the wizzard.</p>
										<p>I have recently added detailed charts for existing coins. The most important column is the profitability (wherever it exists). <br>
										  In short what you need to know is that :<strong> HIGHER PROFITABILITY = START MINING NOW</strong>!!!!
										(And exchange to BitCoin as soon as)</p>
